The default/standardized way to serve static files in your Flask Application is by 
using the "static" folder in the root of your Python project. You can change this 
by adding the keyword argument of "static_folder" during initialization of Flask.
An example of how this looks/works

static 
    html
        index.html
    css
        index.css
    uploads
        pfp.png

And you can now access them like so

Create React App
---------------------------------------
localhost:3000/static/html/index.html
localhost:3000/static/css/index.css
localhost:3000/static/uploads/pfp.png
