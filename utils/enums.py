# To create a type for our Flask Model that would be suitable for the column named "role" we
# first need to import the built in "enum" package. And using this package we will create a class
# that will inherit from this "enum.Enum" package and represent the possible values. So it would
# look something like this.

from enum import Enum

class Role(Enum):
    USER = "user"
    ADMIN = "admin"
    OWNER = "owner"

# Now we can pass this "Role" class into the Mapped Type Checker. So like this.
# role: Mapped[Role] = mapped_column(nullable=False, default=Role.USER)

# Alternatively we can also just use the "Literal" import from the built in "typing" package.
# And it will also work well with the Mapped Type Checker.

# from typing import Literal

# Role = Literal['guest', 'admin', 'owner']
